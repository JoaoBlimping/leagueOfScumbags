General
----


Fighting
--------
 - convert to using new input system.
 - make you be able to switch weapons.
 - add sound effects
 - add music
 - add a strafe button, and also like a reverse strafe that lets you stand on
   spot and aim. I think they would work well as left trigger buttons on a
   controller.

Overworld
---------
 - add music
 - make it that actors are loaded from the map file, and that is where all their
   trash is stored.
 - add things to make characters move around based on a script and stuff.
