# TODO
## Fighting
 - add some kind of mana
   bar so that the amount of time it takes to fire a certain weapon can decrease
   as the player becomes more powerful. Also some kind of delay bar. make it
   decrease with real time so the tingo doesn't get ebola.
 - make you be able to switch weapons.
 - add sound effects
 - add music
 - make the level destructible. probably add a property to certain tiles that
   means they can be destroyed if a bullet hits them. also make tiles smaller
 - add support for gamepads and stuff, and also make it modular enough that
   multiplayer might work.
 - add a strafe button, and also like a reverse strafe that lets you stand on
   spot and aim. I think they would work well as left trigger buttons on a
   controller.

## Overworld
 - make it that actors are loaded from the map file, and that is where all their
   trash is stored.
 - add the event system that will let you do all the cool story stuff and that
