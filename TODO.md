General
----
- bug where the music system can't stop a song once it's repeated.
- make maps have different backgrounds. Maybe I'll just make it that they have
  picture backgrounds because I am lazy, and also I think they can be used to
  a more spooky effect than the glsl backgrounds. So that means I will need to
  read maps's background colours and put that at the very bottom, and then have
  an optional background picture as well.
- add a transition thingo which will receive a pic of the previous screen
  somehow and then it will somehow do a groovy transition


Fighting
--------
 - convert to using new input system.
 - make you be able to switch weapons.
 - add sound effects
 - add music
 - add a strafe button, and also like a reverse strafe that lets you stand on
   spot and aim. I think they would work well as left trigger buttons on a
   controller.
 - you seem to be able to walk through walls and all this stuff at the moment


Overworld
---------
 - add things to make characters move around based on a script and stuff.
 - fix the way the player interacts with npcs so that you don't have to walking
   into them to talk to them, and it doesn't repeat if you are still walking, or
   they are. make it when you press A, it outputs an invisible thing which
   activates an npc if it hits them.
 - make it that battles can be triggered from the overworld by specifying a map.
 - rip off all of rpgmaker's features pretty much
