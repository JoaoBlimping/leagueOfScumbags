TODO

I need to remember to keep the scope reasonable so that I can actually finish
this game without dying first. Then I can add more features for the sequel.
On the other hand, it needs to actually have something good about it.
Polishing the combat and making the story and characters not suck is probably
the most important part of that, though.

General
-------
- groovy transition into battles. make it some stupid picture zooms into the
  screen or something.

- script doesn't continue at end of battle. maybe make it that you set what
  script to run if you win the battle and if you lose or something like that.
  normally if you lose it would just go to game over, but maybe not all the time

- make a shell script to build desktop packages

- start using texture atlases and prioritising them when the new version comes
  out. have an atlas for fighters, actors, and bullets

Fighting
--------


Overworld
---------
 - fix the way the player interacts with npcs so that you don't have to walking
   into them to talk to them, and it doesn't repeat if you are still walking, or
   they are. make it when you press A, it outputs an invisible thing which
   activates an npc if it hits them.

- make it you can open a menu that lets you save and lets you inspect your party
  and that sort of thing.

- make it a actor page's script can start the moment the page starts.

- add background sounds
