TODO

I need to remember to keep the scope reasonable so that I can actually finish
this game without dying first. Then I can add more features for the sequel.
On the other hand, it needs to actually have something good about it.
Polishing the combat and making the story and characters not suck is probably
the most important part of that, though.

General
-------
- script doesn't continue at end of battle. make it that you can either have
  battles that cause game over, or ones the set the outcome to a switch

- start using texture atlases and prioritising them when the new version comes
  out. have an atlas for fighters, actors, and bullets



Fighting
--------
- rebalance the weapons


Overworld
---------
- groovy transition into battles. make it some stupid picture zooms into the
  screen or something.

- add background sounds

- save the positions of all actors when you save or enter a battle, and load
  them again upon your return
