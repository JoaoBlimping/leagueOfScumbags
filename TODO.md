For this release
===============
- make it that actors can activate just by touching you


- the way it tells if a battle is over still isn't quite right

- the credits never end if you minimise them or press gamepad buttons during
  them

- add an animation player type thing to display little animations either on
  actors, or in regions

- add a thing to chuck a comprihensible error message when you put in a
  nonexistent region

- make a gui thing that waits for a sound to play all the way through.

- allow fade out and fade in for scenes, and give it different colours too, just
  to be groovy, but also make them optional so I can slack off
