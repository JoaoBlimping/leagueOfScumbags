For this release
===============
- the way it tells if a battle is over still isn't quite right

- the credits never end if you minimise them or press buttons during them

- add an animation player type thing to display little animations either on
  actors, or in regions


For the Sequel
==============
- add a system to automatically add grass and stuff which is an image object
  so that it can be sorted with the player, it should also be passable, and
  give it animation too. Also make it that they are automatically added to
  certain types of tiles or something so that I don't have to add them by hand.
  hey, it could also be used for rain. or weird pulsating things.

- start using texture atlases and prioritising them when the new version comes
  out. have an atlas for fighters, actors, and bullets, and doodad thingies
