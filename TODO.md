General

Fighting
--------
 - convert to using new input system.
 - make you be able to switch weapons.
 - add sound effects
 - add music
 - add a strafe button, and also like a reverse strafe that lets you stand on
   spot and aim. I think they would work well as left trigger buttons on a
   controller.


Overworld
---------
 - add things to make characters move around based on a script and stuff.
 - fix the way the player interacts with npcs so that you don't have to walking
   into them to talk to them, and it doesn't repeat if you are still walking, or
   they are. make it when you press A, it outputs an invisible thing which
   activates an npc if it hits them.
 - make map loading completely proper so that there can be different tilesets,
   music, and backgrounds
 - make it that battles can be triggered from the overworld by specifying a map.
 - game saving.
 - rip off all of rpgmaker's features pretty much
